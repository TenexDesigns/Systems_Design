There are several NoSQL databases that are free and open-source. Some popular free NoSQL databases are:

1. MongoDB: MongoDB is a document-based NoSQL database that stores data in JSON-like documents. It is widely used for various applications, including content management systems, real-time analytics, and IoT applications.

2. Apache Cassandra: Cassandra is a distributed and decentralized NoSQL database designed to handle large volumes of data with high availability and scalability. It is suitable for use cases like time-series data, sensor data, and online applications.

3. Couchbase: Couchbase is a key-value and document-based NoSQL database that supports flexible data models, including JSON documents. It is known for its fast and low-latency performance.

4. Apache CouchDB: CouchDB is a document-based NoSQL database that allows for easy synchronization of data across multiple devices. It is suitable for use cases requiring offline access and data synchronization.

5. Redis: Redis is an in-memory data store that supports various data structures like strings, lists, sets, and sorted sets. It is commonly used for caching, session management, real-time analytics, and pub/sub messaging.

6. Apache HBase: HBase is a distributed column-family NoSQL database that runs on top of Hadoop. It is designed for handling large-scale, sparse data sets.

7. Neo4j: Neo4j is a graph database that stores data in nodes, relationships, and properties. It is used for applications requiring complex relationship queries, such as social networks and recommendation systems.

Types of NoSQL Databases:
1. Document Stores: These databases store data in flexible JSON-like documents, where each document can have its own structure. Examples include MongoDB and Couchbase.

2. Key-Value Stores: Key-value databases store data in a simple key-value format, where each value is associated with a unique key. Examples include Redis and Riak.

3. Column-Family Stores: Column-family databases store data in columns rather than rows, making them efficient for handling large-scale, sparse data. Examples include Apache Cassandra and HBase.

4. Graph Databases: Graph databases are designed to store and process data in the form of nodes, relationships, and properties, making them suitable for applications with complex relationships. Examples include Neo4j and Amazon Neptune.

5. Time-Series Databases: Time-series databases are optimized for storing and retrieving time-stamped data, such as logs, metrics, and sensor data. Examples include InfluxDB and OpenTSDB.

When choosing a NoSQL database, consider factors such as data model requirements, scalability, performance, and ease of use. Each type of NoSQL database has its strengths and is suited for specific use cases, so understanding the nature of your data and the needs of your application is crucial in making the right choice.
